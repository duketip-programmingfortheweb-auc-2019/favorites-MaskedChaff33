<h1>History</h1>
<h2>1900s</h2>
<p>A new sport in England called Football started to influence the Spanish country in the early 20th Century. It's quick uptake meant that in around this time, the first organisations were created for it's competition. Including Madrid Football Club. Four men named Adolfo Meléndez, Julián Palacios, Juan Padrós, and Carlos Padrós on March 6, 2019 came together to create the Madrid based team that is known Today.</p> 
<h2>1910s</h2>
<p>Now during this point, Spanish footbal was going through a period of difficulty, but was overcame by Madrid Football Club, who later that decade were Granted the name Real(Meaning Royal, Kingly) due to their outstading performances and hard work through out the decade.</p>
<h2>1920s</h2>
<p>Real Madrid later returned to dominance in Spanish football after a rough previous decade, then started to compete abroad their homeland. The first game of La Liga Santander was hosted at this time, in Real's newly built stadium, Chamartin</p>
<h2>1930s</h2>
<p>The arrival of the all time great defensive trio(Ricardo Zamora, Ciriaco, Quincoces) brought 4 titles in as many years, spreading Madrid's reputation throught the continent of Europe, but their blaze of fire was cut short by the outbreak of the Civil War in Spain.  </h2>
<h2>1940s</h2>
<p>After the Civil War cooled down in the country, Madrid had to be rebuilt in order to be brought up to speed for the competition. This decade would also give rise to the evergreen rivalry between Catlan Team Barcelona. But thanks to Santiago Bernabeu, these challages were all met with ease and succes. This decade set the foundation of the Centurion Winning Team. </p>
<h2>1950s</h2>
<p>This was possible the best decade in the history of Real Madrid Football. A pleiad of all time greats, let by Alfredo Di Stefano and Ferenc Puskas, Madrid was put at the summit of world football, winning 5 European Cups in a row. Winning the first version of the intercontinental cup and several La Liga's, the 'king of kings' were officialy the best club in football.</p>
<h2>1960s</h2>
<p>This was a period of change for the club. In Spain it was far superior, winning eight La Liga's, and the team also celebrated its Sixth European Cup</p>
<h2>1970s</h2>
<p>This decade marked the year of the new league in Spain, La Liga Santander, who Real Madrid won 6 times in, but was marked by the Death of Santiago Bernabeu, who was the person who took Real Madrid to the top of world football. He was Replaced by Luis de Carlos, who represented Madrid with just as much pride and passion as Santiago, but fell short in the stragegy category. He resigned after 7 years. </p>
<h2>1980s</h2>
<p> The 80s were marked by a team of a young, bright team, led by Hugo Sanchez. Le Bleus whon the first two UEFA cups with some glamorous nights in Madrid. </p>
<h2>1990s</h2>
<p>The 90s was not a very active decade for the whites. But late in the decade, legends like Laudrup, Seedorf, and Roberto Carlos came, starting the golden generation of football in the world.</p>
<h2>2000s</h2>
<p>In this decade Real Madrid made a proud return to triumph on the continent, winning it's 9th European Cup, its third Intercontinental cup, 5 La Liga Santander's, and more. Madrid boasted some of the Greatest players of all time, including David Beckham, Sergio Ramos, Ronaldo Nazario, Zidane, and more. Late in the decade marked the arrival of the greatest Real Madrid player, arguably the Greatest player, of all time. Cristiano Ronaldo. </p>
<h2>2010s</h2>
<p> Real Madrid have again defined an era in world football, winning four European Cups and four club world cups. Led by Cristiano Ronaldo through the decade, and Zidane coming in as manager in 2016, Madrid led the world once again. What more, in 2017, Real Madrid got their hands on 5 trophies. Currently, Real are recovering from a poor season as Zidane rebuilds the team, as Santiago Bernabeu did back then.</p>
